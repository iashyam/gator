Now that I am without your kisses 
I will be needing stiches. 

Got a feeling that I going under
but I know that I will make it out alive
if i quite calling you my lover 
and move on
you watch me 


you watch me bleed until I can't breath 
shaking falling onto my knees
and now that
I am without your kisses
I will be needing stiches. 

tripping your myself
aching
beggin you to come help
and now that
I am without your kisses
I will be needing stiches. 

needle and a thread
got to get you out of my head
needle and a thread
gonna be wind up dead. 

you watch me bleed until I can't breath 
shaking falling onto my knees
and now that
I am without your kisses
I will be needing stiches. 

tripping your myself
aching
beggin you to come help
and now that
I am without your kisses
I will be needing stiches.
